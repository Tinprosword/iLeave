                intellectual property right in a patent, copyright, or trade secret, we shall defend, and shall indemnify and hold 
                you harmless by paying any resulting costs and damages finally awarded by a court with respect to any such claim provided that you:

                designs or formulas that you provide.  If you are prevented from using the Software because of an actual or claimed infringement, 
                then at our option, we shall promptly either obtain for you the right to continue using the affected part of the Software, replace or modify the 
                affected part of the Software so that it becomes non-infringing, or if none of the foregoing alternatives are possible after we exercise commercially reasonable
